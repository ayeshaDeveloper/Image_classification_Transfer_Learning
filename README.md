# Image Classification with Transfer Learning

## Overview
This project demonstrates the application of transfer learning in image classification using the VGG16 pre-trained model, compared with a model trained from scratch. Both approaches were tested on the Natural Scenes dataset, which consists of 25k images across six categories: buildings, forest, glacier, mountain, sea, and street.

## Dataset
The **Natural Scenes dataset** is sourced from Kaggle and includes:
- **Total Images**: 25,000
- **Size**: 150x150 pixels
- **Categories**: 6 (buildings, forest, glacier, mountain, sea, street)
- **Distribution**: The dataset is divided into 14k training images, 3k testing images, and 7k prediction images. The category distribution is visualized in the included pie chart, highlighting a larger proportion of 'mountain' and 'glacier' images.

## Models
### Transfer Learning Model: VGG16
- **Pre-trained on ImageNet**
- **Architecture Details**: VGG16 is a convolutional neural network known for its effectiveness in feature extraction, with layers configured as follows:
  - Multiple convolutional layers with 3x3 filters, increasing in depth from 64 to 512.
  - Max pooling layers following sets of convolutional layers.
  - Fully connected layers leading up to a softmax output layer.
- **Fine-Tuning Approach**: Initial layers frozen, output layer redefined for 6 categories, and later layers optionally unfrozen for detailed tuning.

### Scratch Model
- **Custom CNN Architecture**
- **Setup**: Sequential convolutional layers with increasing filter depth (32, 64, 128), followed by max pooling, a flattening step, and a dense network ending in a softmax classification layer.

## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/image_classification_transfer_learning.git
cd image_classification_transfer_learning
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Train and evaluate the models with:
```bash
python train.py
python evaluate.py
```

## Results and Performance
- **VGG16 (Transfer Learning)**
  - Training Accuracy: 75.22%
  - Validation Accuracy: 80.06%
  - Training Time per Epoch: ~12 minutes
- **Model from Scratch**
  - Training Accuracy: 19.88%
  - Validation Accuracy: 17.13%
  - Training Time per Epoch: ~40 minutes

## Conclusions
Transfer learning significantly enhances efficiency and model accuracy with limited data, demonstrating robust performance against a model trained from scratch.
